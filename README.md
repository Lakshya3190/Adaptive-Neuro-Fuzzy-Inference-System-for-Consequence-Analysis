# Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy Descision Support for Consequence Analysis
An ANFIS model for ECA of brick structures is developed and implemented on MATLAB Simulink.
- No. of fuzzy controllers: 1
- No. of fuzzy rules: 140
- No. of inputs: 3 
- Output: Damage to brick structures
- Data: UN SaferGuard
- RMSE Error: 0.05
